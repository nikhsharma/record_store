The brief for this project is as follows:

## Record Store

The owner of a Record Store wants an app which will help to keep on top of the store inventory. This is not an app that customers will see, but will be used to check stock levels and see what needs to be ordered soon.

You should be able to add stock, which would have an Artist and Album as well as the quantity available.

### MVP:

- <strike>Create albums with the quantity that are in stock</strike>
- <strike>Create artists</strike>
- <strike>Show an inventory page listing albums and artists</strike>
- <strike>Show a stock level for the inventory items e.g. High/Medium/Low</strike>

### Possible Extensions:

- <strike>Add a buy and sell price to each stock item</strike>
- <strike>Calculate the possible markup on items and show on inventory page</strike>
- <strike>Add a genre to an Album</strike>
- Any other ideas you might come up with
